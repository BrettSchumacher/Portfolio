# My Projects and Research
## Sim-Stem - A Physics Simulation puzzle game
### Made in June 2021, URL: <https://theshoes.itch.io/sim-stem>

Developed over a weekend for the GMTK 2021 Game Jam. The game features a real time physics simulation to mimic orbital mechanics. The player must properly set planet's starting positions and velocities to reach certain goals and avoid certain obstacles. All simulation and gameplay code was written by me, with help from friends on the UI code, level design, and music for the game.

## FIVE - Flexible Immersive Virtual Environments
### Made June 2021 - Sept 2021, URL: <https://conservancy.umn.edu/handle/11299/223271>

Developed in Unity as a part of a UROP (Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program) at the University of Minnesota under the guidance of Professor Evan Suma Rosenberg and with fellow CSCI undergrad Malik Khadar.  Created in Unity, FIVE is a Virtual Reality framework that allows developers to build their scenes so that they will automatically scale to a VR user's physical space.
