# About Me

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66701198/138022866-2e05cead-6bd3-4b72-8d50-a53a98d427a2.png)

My name is Brett Schumacher. I'm a 10 year-old Computer Science Major at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

#### Interests

Computer Graphics and simulation are the most exciting fields of Computer Science for me, especially simulations that offer some form of interactivity.
Due to its interactivity, Game Development is one of my favorite hobbies, and I currently develop in Unity with the UMN Video Game Development Club.
