# About Me

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/66701198/138022866-2e05cead-6bd3-4b72-8d50-a53a98d427a2.png)

My name is Brett Schumacher. I'm a 20 year-old Comp Sci Major/Astrophysics Minor at the University of Minnesota Twin Cities.

#### Interests

I enjoy implementing physics simulations as well as learning about computer graphics, particualarly in the context of video game development. 
I also like to design and implement game systems in my free time (currently with the UMN Video Game Development Club).
